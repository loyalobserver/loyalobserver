Joost Coté argues that the International Colonial Exhibition in Semarang (1914) provided a panoptical overview of the promise of modernity in a colonial setting. He uses the term colonial modernity as a concept to describe the project, which means fundamentally two things: 1. a sense of modernity expressed in a concern for reform and progress; 2. the greater concern for controlling the boundaries of the colonial order. Coté sees the city centers as the main sites for the colonial government to impose modernization, to find new ways of coexistence for governing colonial interaction. However, he also proposes that contradictorily, the colonial exhibition contributed to the embryonic nationalist agenda. Colonial exhibitions "supported" the formation of nationalism in two ways: first, it provided the native visitor a stunning overview of the potential nation in embryo; second, it set up a discourse of tradition. Ultimately, Coté argues that the Java-exhibition goers, despite being the object of the exhibition, might have received the knowledge without necessarily submitting to the colonial vision.
