This book is A+. It provides in great detail the historical development of plantation in East Sumatra with very informed insight about the process of planting, the different kinds of plants and their relation to land, the history of the estates, and the conflicts between various groups of people. Many spatial innovations are also discussed by Pelzer, including the planting rotation, nipa palm as roof materials (very useful for fermentation process). (In)equitable sharing of the land with local population remained one of the cause of conflicts. The colonial government also brought many regulations that created disadvantages for local population. The issue of illegal tapping of rubber trees also became a significant situation in the late colonial period, and the proximity of sites and the indifferent between industrial and stolen latex created the problem. Pelzer also discussed the contract system of Chinese labor, which was based on quantity and quality of products. In these four chapters, Pelzer has not touched his main argument, mainly setting the historical background for the sake of readers' comprehension.
