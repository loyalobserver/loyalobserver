I read this because Wayne Yang referred the text several times in his article "Plantation Logic, Or, Who Plots an Architecture of Freedom?" McKittrick shows the ways in which the logic of plantation is entrenched in urban space, in how and where we live now, and therefore understanding the conceptual work of black geogprahies and the plantation can provide us a way to conceptualize our collective futures. She uses the term "plantation futures": "a conceptualization of time-space that tracks the plantation toward the prison and the impoverished and destroyed city sectors and, consequently, brings into sharp focus the ways the plantation is an ongoing locus of antiblack violence and death that can no longer analytically sustain this violence." In the body of the essay, McKittrick elaborates various sites of continuation. First, she discusses the uninhabitable, which is repeated in the logic of slums. And then, she describes how the plantation logic constitutes features such as the economy, the landscape, and the architecture that go hand in hand with different kinds and types of racial violence. Afterward, she discusses plot-and-plantation, how "secretive histories" are also planned in the plots (just like the plot in the novel, which connection with plantation was discussed by Sylvia Winter), the histories that "undo the telological and biocentric underpinnings of spaitality." At the end of essay, McKrittick draws the relation between the plantation pasts and futures and the work of survival. She argues that the plantation futures are "a spatial politics of living just enough," "a political location that fosters more humanly workable, and alterable, geographic practices."
