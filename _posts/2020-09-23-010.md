This essay disputes the notion of dual cities, proposing instead that racial divisions embedded in colonial cities were neither complete nor static. This blurring of boundaries existed in the heterogenous use as well as the heterogenous population who inhabited the buildings. Chattopadhyay shows these heterogeneities by breaking down the genealogy of European residential through a few examples, which show both the failed attempt in separating private domain (house) from public domain (cities) and the penetration of domesticity in the existence of enslaved population, which embodied in the spatial arrangement of European residences. At the end of the essay is the interesting analogy of "opera" used to describe the European house in Calcutta. Unlike houses in Europe that separates service and non-service area rigidly as well as being clear about beginning-middle-end, the colonial house in Calcutta often showcases an openness/connectedness, often based on a series of frontal planes but on a concentric arrangement to allow multiple points of entrance and dispersal. This arrangement is, according to the author, extended to the city.The author summarizes this in a great line: "The pleasure of imperialism did not simply necessitate the native presence among the colonizers--indeed, they were besieged by native practices in hte very center of domestic life." This hybridity is a troubling presence, but it is at the same time "the consequence of everyday practices that inflected their own behavior and their ability to sustain a narrative of superior difference."Â
