This part shows how the "social revolution" in Aceh and East Sumatra, a historical process that eventually ended the traditional government (kerajaan) in northern Sumtra, took shape. The historical facts told by this book are so rich, coming from not only archival works but also dozens of interviews. The narrative renders the cultural and political complexity of East Sumatra visible, showing the different agencies involved in the event of "social revolution" and their negotiations that led to the killings of many members of existing monarchies. The result is a very complex story in a good way, as any form of revolution has to be a complex situation. It is not easy to read this chapter without reading the previous parts, as so many names and institutions came out, but Reid did a good job in making the story engaging. Unfortunately, he did not explore the theoretical bearing of "social revolution," but that should not devalue the quality of the book as a historical project. One thing that I felt lacking is the part where the radical revolution somehow died just like that. Reid only argues that the leader did not have a clear strategy post-revolution. I just cannot believe that "the thrust of the 'social revolution" was decisively over without any resistance.
