The article proposes to disconnect the rise of urban middle classes from nationalism. Studies that connect both, according to Nordholt, obscures two things: 1. The fact that the radical nationalist movement of the 1920s and 1930s consisted only a minority of the collective that shared the anticolonial sentiment, and that there were internal differences of the members who were culturally oriented and regionally anchored; 2. The fact that the majority of the indigenous native middle classes were primarily more interested in modernity, thus they aimed for a lifestyle than for a nation. Nordholt focuses on the second point, showing the ways in which colonial citizenship was primarily cultural citizenship by analyzing the making of that citizenship itself through various advertisements during the colonial period.
