The article is rather hard to summarize as it has various points to tell. Yang goes to argue that sustainability is the settler colonial future (modernism and "slum clearance" being the prior narratives of progress, and long before that, settlement and civilization.) In sustainability, Yang sees the plantation logics. Then, Yang shows how sustainability is parallel with plantation logics in its narratives of self-sustain, as they are both has "'a built-in capacity to maintain itself' through its interdependence with racial violence and extraction in remote elsewheres." Then, there comes the "plot," a play of word, of both of design and of story. Yang argues that in plantations lies the "plot," a possibility of counternarrative.
