This article argues that lectures are as relevant as other forms of teaching in promoting active learning. They are essential for cultivating some basic humanities skills: comprehension and reasoning. The argument that says learning through lectures is passive is questionable, since a good lecture keeps students' minds in energetic and simultaneous action. Even more important in today's world, a good lecture teaches us the art of attention, an art that has been even harder to learn due to the omnipresence of gadgets and disruptive nature of social media. In good lectures, we see how professors build their arguments, a process which requires us to synthesize and engage the arguments as we listen. Another important skill in relation to listening: note-taking, another aspect of lectures that we often forget but indeed a crucial part of active learning. The work that we do in lecture classes can prepare us better to face seminar discussions.
