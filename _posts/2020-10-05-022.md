In this article, Chakrabarty discusses the complexity of the notion of human in the Anthropocene as it becomes a category of geological force. Chakrabarty argues that we need to think of the two figures of the human simultaneously: the human-human and the nonhuman-human. We need to think numbers as much as human experience. The problem here is that despite it being our mode of collective existence, we can never experience ourselves as a geophysical force. We can experience the impact of it mediated by other experiences such as through "natural" disasters, but our being as geological agency has no ontological dimension. Thus, we need to think the human on multiple scales and registers and as having both ontological and nonontological modes of existence. Human now exist in two diferent modes: one win which they are still concerned with justice, and another (as climate scientists pointed out) in which we are "indifferent" or "neutral" to question of intrahuman justice (you may call this mode a "species" but it has no ontology). Chakrabarty does not explain further how we can think both modes of existence in parallel.
