These two chapters focus on agrarian policy, especially the legal, political, and economic factors which contributed to the phenomenal development of plantation agriculture in East Sumatra as well as the problem of converting agricultural concession into long leases. The latter may not be of that use for my dissertation, but the former surely does. It examines the making of model contracts to uniformize the agrarian policy. Important to the revisions of model contracts: the differentiation between empty land and waste land (the latter has never been part of adat's idea of land), the kampong reserve and the reserve for households, the forbidding of transfering agrarian rights from locals to other Indonesians. Pelzer shows that planters actually had many disagreements with the colonial government. I should come back these two chapters on another occasion, but for now good to know that someone did a comprehensive study on the land regulation.
