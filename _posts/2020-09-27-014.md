So, I have a dog for almost a month now. Her name is Moka. I have been training her without any former experience, so I thought I need a book to get better. This book seems to be quite reader friendly, therefore I am going to try to read it until the end.
<br/><br/>The early chapters are more an introductory part. Starting from chapter 3, things become more useful. Steve explains here that there are four stages of learning: acquisition (learning with being lured), automation (learning without being lured), generalization (changing the condition of learning to make your dog get used to different situations), and maintenance (stage in which your dog consistently complying with the command).
<br/<br/>Steve mentions that it is important to build dog's desire to perform the command than to develop avoidance behaviour. You may also want to avoid correction until at least the automation stage. Focus on success and rewarding it than on punishment. Finally, pattern training requires consistency, including of the place where you train each command.
