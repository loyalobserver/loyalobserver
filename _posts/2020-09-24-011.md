Van der Meer explains the proliferation of annual fairs and exhibitions as part of a larger project to establish cultural hegemony and to legitimize colonial authority. This project was achieved by demonstrating the benevolence of colonial governance, while emphasizing the superiority of the West modernization. Aiming at Indonesian middle class, those fairs promoted consumer practices (leisure, exhibits, food, and commodities), offering visitors the experience of modernity through architecture, performances, advertisements, and commercial displays. Van der Meer relates this proliferation to the Dutch commitment to the Ethical Policy. This relation includes the many recurring exhibitions on hygiene and sanitation which were significantly inserted in the annual fairs of the 1920s and 1930s, organized by the Dienst der Volksgezondheid. The images appeared in those fairs often contrasted Western modernity with Javanese backwardness, an operation that the author deems as legitimizing colonial authority. Two other significant attempts in this article: showing, through statistics and images, the fairs as sites which were significantly aiming at native middle class, and demonstrating how those sites become discursive spaces, inviting dissenting opinions from the natives, publicized in many local newspapers.
