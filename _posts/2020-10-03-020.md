When I read Reid's account on the social revolution, I thought it was really great. But then there is so much more to offer in regard to the history of the independence, and Steedly work shows that, the multidimensionality of the struggle towards freedom. Central to her account is the women's wartime experience, which may stand in contrast against the heroic narrative dominantly written by men and about men. I have always had admiration to those who do ethnographic accounts, and this is exactly one of that accounts that brought admiration. Steedly artfully weaves interviews, archives, and theories. The stories of Nande Senantiasa Beru Bangun, who had to burn her own house, and Piah Manik, who had to bury guns that would eventually played a central role for the independence claim by Governor Hasan, are central to the chapters I read. Steedly paints a more nuanced picture of "revolution," and indeed a beautiful one, with stories that would never enter our national narrative.
