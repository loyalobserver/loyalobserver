Anderson provides a critique of decolonial method, questioning the structural binarism of this theoretical framework. He argues that decolonial's binarism can lead to essentialist argument (see Spivak: the danger of strategic essentialism), meanwhile pointing out the incommensurability of the "ontological" turn of decoloniality ("the scope of an epistemic assemblage that would necessarily sabotage and supersede settler colonialism linguistic, narrative, and temporal protocols, disturbing standardized assumptions about evidence, agency, and authorship"). He asks whether "decolonial" then is "imaginable except as metaphor or ideal." Nevertheless, he points out that many of decolonial practical operation is actually embedded in postcolonial framework. He uses his own work as evidence, for instance, his book *The Collectors of Lost Souls* and his article in *East Asian Science, Technology and Society*, which promotes the multiplying of reference from Asia (following Chen Kuan-hsing's *Asia as Method* while also being aware of internal colonialism that also happens in Asia), thus, although he frames it as postcolonial, the method is actually aligned with decolonial strategies. In the end, Anderson recites his preference toward postcolonial framework, its attempt at working at multiple scales, engaging with multiplicity and contradiction, inhabiting paradox. (citing James Clifford, Returns: Becoming Indigenous in the Twenty-First Century).
