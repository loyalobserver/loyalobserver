The article shows how architecture of memorial symbolism in Brasilia is based on the bounds between modernity and coloniality. According to Tavares, the creation of Brasilia, manifest in numerous plans, projects, and architecture, serves as a platform to launch a new occupation and integration front over the Amazon forest. He extends the analysis into the removal, defacement, destruction of monuments, arguing that those acts in themselves established new public memorials serving as counters to the hegemonic narratives. As of today, he points out that Brazilians are still celebrating settler colonialism as an integral part of their history, but he calls for deconstruction and re-signification of those memories not just to promote plural narratives but also as a form of historical reparation.
