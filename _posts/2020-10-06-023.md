Kallipoliti extends Banham's notion of well-tempered environment by examining architectural experimentations that brought forward ideas and imaginaries of closed worlds. Thus the book focuses on those projects that attempted to established closed ecology, devising architecture as a regulatory machines that recirculate material and energy resources. Here then lies the believe that architecture can serve to naturalize and reproduce sections of the world, despite its fully integration within the very fabric of reality. Kallipoliti uses words such as synthetic environment, enclosure, environmental bubble, closed ecology, etc., to refer to those self-sustained systems. She also brings up critical analyses, mainly arguing that this kind of projects in fact demonstrates that "their recirculatory machines are no more robust than a fragile stomach, the operation of which, to efficiently convert input to output and leave no leftovers, is unstable at best," and hence the significance of understanding the power of digestion. Here is where vomit and shit become important. She ends with a positive notes, saying that the utopias of closed worlds can indeed provide us with new ways to fathom via interiorization as the need for embeddedness in the world become obsolete. (absolutely disagree!)
