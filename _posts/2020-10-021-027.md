title: "027: Priya Satia, 'The Problem with Waiting for History to Judge the Present' <em>Time.com</em> October 20, 2020"

Another critique of the use of history as a source of truth in the future, or as a retrospective judgement ("history will judge"). Satia argues that history tells how we got here, not what should be, thus, we need to stop thinking that history will tell the right and wrong of the present. We need to "recover other guides to conscience, not just look to future historians for consolation." The article is not as insightful as I first imagined, and I thought it is a missed opportunity that she does not explore the subjective positions of historians. She calls different names to suggest how those names used "history" wrongfully, but she does not really elaborate on the role of historians and histories.
